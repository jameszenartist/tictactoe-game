# Tic Tac Toe Game in React

### Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe App using React!

<br />

As I've been strengthening my abilities with React, I decided to build a fully functional tic tac toe game!

While I'm content with its current state, I intend on making iterative imporvements upon this project in the near future and as much as I can!

### Thanks for looking!
